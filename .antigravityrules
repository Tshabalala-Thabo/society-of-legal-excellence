# Antigravity Rules

## Critical Instructions
- **ALWAYS** read the [Project Design Guide](docs/design_guide.md) before writing any code or making design decisions.
- Ensure all UI components align with the brand guidelines defined in the design guide.
- Use the `User` model instead of `Admin` for all user-related operations, but keep the "Admin Portal" terminology for the back-office UI.
